                        <p>If your website is facing a slow loading time, it can put a negative impact on your website in front of your customers and they will not prefer to visit your website in the future.</p>
                        <p>In the case of custom websites, there are not many issues with the website’s loading speed. Even if you are facing it, you must eradicate or eliminate the unnecessary plug-ins and just include the specific functionalities in your website which are required.</p>
