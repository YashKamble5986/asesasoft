                        <h3 class="mb-3 blogTitle">2. Use Action-Oriented Language That Is Clear And Concise</h3>
                        <p>By choosing words that are goal-oriented, you convey your message effectively and increase the likelihood of achieving your desired outcomes. </p>
                        <p>Focus on using strong verbs and avoiding vague or overly complex language. </p>
                        <p>Action-oriented language is something where probabilities are eliminated. For example, avoid using words like:</p>
                        <p>Can, will, shall, may, ought to…</p>
                        <p>Instead, use - the present continuous tense.</p>

                        <p>Creating a sense of urgency is a powerful tool for driving sales. The time-sensitive language creates this urgency and encourages customers to act quickly. </p>
                        <p>By emphasizing the scarcity of your product or service, customers are forced to take quick action. Thus making your sales faster. </p>
                        <p>Usually, items are immediately added to the cart but after a period of time, the <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/shopping-cart-abandonment/" target="_blank">cart is abandoned.</a> </p>
                        <p>Time-sensitive language is:</p>
                        <p>while supplies last </p>
                        <p>offer ends in XXX</p>

                        <p>The successful <a href="https://asesasoft.com/blog/outstanding-ecommerce-website-design-tips" target="_blank">e-commerce websites</a> out there have their <a href="https://www.zoho.com/commerce/insights/buy-now-button.html" target="_blank">buy now button</a> in yellow and add to cart button in orange colour. And you will notice nearly 90% of the <a href="https://asesasoft.com/blog/ecommerce-best-practices-and-tips" target="_blank">eCommerce store</a> has the same colour. </p>
                        <p>Is it a copycat scenario?</p>   
                        <p>For some, yes. </p>
                        <p>But pioneers of the forte have run a whole human psychology theory behind this.</p>
                        <p>As there are action-oriented words, there are action-oriented colours and fonts and sizes too. 
                            And even numbers. Hence, your prices should be in accordance with that. </p>
                        <p>For instance, let your <a href="https://asesasoft.com/knowledge-base" target="_blank">CTA button</a> be brighter and more energetic in colour, vibrant, slightly animated like popping up. Make sure that animation of the call to action shouldn’t be irritating. It should just serve its purpose - attention-grabbing. </p>

                        <p>Users are more likely to hit your <strong>call to action</strong> button if it is rightly placed. </p>
                        <p>If you are having your selling page, make use of your call to action at least 3-4 times.</p>

                        <p>Incorporate images or videos that showcase your product or service by illustrating its features and benefits. Visual elements that are consistent with your brand identity help to reinforce your messaging and build brand recognition. </p>

                        <p>The <strong>lead magnet</strong> could be as simple as a <strong>free newsletter</strong>, daily tips, hacks or anything relevant to your service that solves your target audience’s pain point. Offer the lead magnet for Free, or for the least price that you can afford.</p>
                        <p>Remember that, a lead magnet is your promotion. So, never mind investing in lead magnets. </p>
