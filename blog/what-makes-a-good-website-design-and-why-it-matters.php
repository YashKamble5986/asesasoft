                        <p>There are actually so many factors that contribute to making your website look pretty and engaging. When you land on a website, you immediately form an impression about it. When your visitors come to your website, they form their impression about you which lasts enough to either make or break your business.</p>
                        <p>So, here’s something that you should consider while designing your website -</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">1. Be aesthetically pleasing</h3>
                        <p><i>Create a vibe with website </i></p>
                        <p>Every <a href="./why-website-design-and-development-is-one-of-the-most-important-aspects-in-business">business needs a good website</a>, but what makes a good website? Professionalism and aesthetics. This is where you need to spend some time put into your design. The aesthetic design may not seem as important as the content of your website, but it is definitely something you should not overlook.</p>
                        <p>People are more likely to buy from companies with websites that are visually appealing. There are a lot of things you can do to <a href="./why-website-design-and-development-is-one-of-the-most-important-aspects-in-business">improve the aesthetics of your website</a>, from choosing a color scheme to adding images and videos to choosing the right typography.</p>
                        <p><a href="../website-design-and-development-company">To make your website aesthetically pleasing</a>, every minute detail matters. Even your spaces and font size, letter spacing and every single thing.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">2. Be easily navigable and readable</h3>
                        <p><i>Befriend your visitor</i></p>
                        <p>A good <a href="../website-design-and-development-company">website design</a> is one that is simple, functional and easy to navigate. <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-navigation/" target="_blank">Website navigation</a> is the core of any website. It is crucial to have a simple and logical navigation structure so the user can find their way around the website effortlessly.</p>
                        <p>By easily navigable, we mean, the website should be clean and clear. When a visitor visits your website, he must know where to go and how to go. Most importantly, he must be willing to go. Your landing page of the website has just one purpose to serve - to create desire.</p>
                        <p>Whatever your website is about, whatever your purpose is, make sure, every visitor leaves as your friend. </p>

                        <p><i>Design a website that narrates your goal</i></p>
                        <p>Make sure your website is communicating the message clearly. Do not let your visitors drift away.</p>
                        <p>Whenever a visitor is landing on a website, the least he is seeking is value. And your communication is the value that you are providing him.</p>

                        <p>Make sure, you are clear with what actions you are expecting your audience to take. This happens with clear communication. Let your audience know your goal, and let them be on your page actually when they are on your page.</p>

                        <p>It shouldn’t be something secret. <br> It shouldn’t need n number of scrolls. <br>It shouldn’t be a riddle.</p>
                        <p>It should be clear at first glance.</p>
                        <p>What are you expecting your readers to do?</p>
                        <p>Are you expecting them to subscribe to your email list, to like you, to share you, to call you, to WhatsApp you, to purchase something from you or do you wish your visitors to come and go simply?</p>
                        <p>Whatever it is, ask them to perform the action on a clear note.</p>
                        <p>Ask them with clickable redirection. <br /> Be simple and clear.</p>
