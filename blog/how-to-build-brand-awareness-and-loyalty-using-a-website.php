                        <p>
                        The real business lies in the community. When a reader comes to your website, the effective way to lock and channel them is to ask them to subscribe to your weekly emails
                            </p>
                        <p>Your weekly emails or newsletter may include market updates, announcements, new launches or your significant achievements. However, it's also advantageous to regularly integrate insights and narratives from external sources.  </p>

                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">6. Incorporating social proof  </h3>
                       
                        <p>By tapping into the force of others' opinions, actions, or beliefs in our decision-making process, utilising social proof is a highly effective way to persuade people to take action. Social proof aids us in developing confidence in other people's proposals and helps us choose actions based on those of others.  </p>
                        <p>One technique to incorporate social proof into your website is to offer user-generated content or customer reviews. This builds trust and faith in prospective consumers by presenting an unbiased picture of your item or service.  </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, demonstrating how your product or service has helped others solve their concerns may be an effective technique for persuading consumers to try it out.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">7. Implementing a loyalty program on your website  </h3>
                       
                        <p>Adding a loyalty programme to your website could increase recognition and patronage. As examples of how your programme might operate, you could provide frequent customers with discounts or special promotions, or you could give customers points or other forms of appreciation for their purchases.  </p>
                        <p>By promoting repeat business, a loyalty programme can assist you in raising your revenue and profitability. Also, if your application is well-built, you might be able to gather client data for upcoming marketing initiatives.  </p>
                        <p>By implementing a solid loyalty programme on your website, you may successfully improve brand awareness and loyalty.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">8. Posting your case studies and faux passes  </h3>
                       
                        <p>On almost every website you will be ending up finding good testimonials. Hence, many readers today, skip the testimony part while scrolling through your website.  </p>
                        <p>To hold up readers’ attention and to give them more genuine reasons to trust you is to disclose your case studies. Instead of showing your portfolios, you can consider discussing every minute detail through which you developed your portfolio. You can put forward the client’s problem statement and exactly how you and your team got to the solution.  </p>
                        <p>This will help your reader understand your process and your business in a transparent manner. </p>
                        <p>Also, instead of just posting testimonials which hardly any reader pays attention to, adding your faux passes and how you learned through them will create a huge impact.  </p>
                        
                    </div>
                     <div class='my-4'>
                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">9. Conveying Brand Message right   </h3>
                       
                        <p>No matter what type of information you are posting, make sure you are conveying the right and consistent message of your brand throughout. Because at last people are going to remember your brand with the message that you are conveying to them.   </p>
                        <p>With your tagline and your <a href="https://asesasoft.com/knowledge-base" target="_blank"> call to action</a>, make sure you are selling yourself right. In the process of building relationships and trust, it is also important to build a customer base that stays loyal to you.   </p>
                        <p>And hence, while you are imparting immense knowledge through your website, keep your call to action in line with what you actually want your audience to perform.  </p>
                        
                        
                    </div>
                     <div class='my-4'>
                        <h3 class="mb-3 pt-2">10. Showcasing real-time customer satisfaction proof    </h3>
                       
                        <p>As we discussed, people don’t read testimonials. And hence, showing testimonials as social proof is actually a thing. Instead, you can actually ask your satisfied customers to take 30 seconds to 2 minutes of video clips to share their experience.  </p>
                        <p>
                    Also, instead of directly publishing a testimonial on your website, you can take a screenshot of a real testimony and post a picture of the same. This creates more impact on the audience. 
                        </p>
