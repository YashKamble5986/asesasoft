                <p>Ecommerce has revolutionized the way people shop. It is estimated that by 2040, eCommerce will account for <a href='https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/uk-online-shopping-and-e-commerce-statistics-2017-2017-03-14' target='_blank'>95 percent</a> of all purchases. To build a sustainable <a href="https://martechseries.com/mobile/mobile-marketing/e-commerce-and-mobile-commerce/benefits-of-having-an-ecommerce-store-for-your-online-presence/" target="_blank">ecommerce business</a>, you need to invest in a solid website. A website gives you the perfect opportunity to show off what your brand offers, foster a deeper engagement with the customers, and boost sales.</p>
                <p>The bad news - there are approximately 24 million ecommerce websites on the internet at present. With new businesses mushrooming every day, it has become more important than ever to invest in the right website design.</p>
                <h6 style='color: #000000;' class='montserratBold_16 mb-3 pt-4'>What does an effective eCommerce web design look like? It comes down to paying attention to the basics, such as:</h6>

                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">Wondering where to begin? Here are some tips for ecommerce website development to kickstart the process:</h2>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">1 - Make your website on brand</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Think of your website as a shop window -- it puts a face to your business and helps customers understand what they can expect from you as a brand. </p>
                        <p>That’s why the website should pay extra attention to branding. It should reflect your brand identity by considering key elements such as color, fonts, voice, and brand personality. </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">2 - Prioritize UX over everything else</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Even the best products can fail to wow your customers unless your website provides a flawless User Experience (<a href="https://www.itproportal.com/features/what-is-ux-when-designing-and-building-websites/" target="_blank">UX</a>). Take, for instance, the loading time of your website. It is one of the key components affecting the UX, and <a href="https://optinmonster.com/ecommerce-user-experience-best-practices/" target="_blank">52 percent of online shoppers</a> believe that fast loading time directly impacts their loyalty towards a site. If your website takes incredibly long to load, you are going to lose out on business.</p>
                        <p>For a great UX, design a clean homepage that is easy to navigate. Use a minimal design, add contrasting colors for call-to-action buttons, use high-quality images, leave adequate whitespace, create a visual hierarchy of various elements, and add different product categories with sidebars.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="pt-4">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/ecommerce-blog-2.jpg" alt="e commerce website creation" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="pt-4">Check how fast your website loads on a mobile device and how easy it is for users to navigate the mobile version. After all, <a href="https://optinmonster.com/mobile-seo/" target="_blank">40 percent of shoppers</a> prefer to use their mobile devices shopping. Optimizing your website for these devices will ensure you don’t lose out on such customers. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">3 - Build a cross-browser compatible website</h2>
                    <p>In this digitally-driven world, the choices of browsers are many. Your website needs to be compatible across a range of browsers and provide a consistent UX.</p>
                    <img src="../images/blogs/ecommerce-blog-3.jpg" alt="ecommerce website browser testing" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="pt-3">Keeping the code simple, using frameworks, and validating HTML and CSS are some of the ways in which a <a href="https://asesasoft.com/website-design-and-development-company" target="_blank"><strong>website development company</strong></a> can ensure cross-browser compatibility. It is also important to run cross-browser compatibility tests to identify the issues that need fixing. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">4 - Don’t ignore hosting</h2>
                    <p>A hosting platform directly impacts your website’s speed and its ability to handle more traffic. As an <a href="https://asesasoft.com/ecommerce-website-development" target="_blank"><strong>eCommerce website designing company</strong></a>, we recommend a cloud hosting plan on platforms such as Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>) or Google Cloud for your website. Cloud-based plans increase your website’s security as the data gets stored in different servers across multiple locations governed by different server protocols.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">5 -  Security is more important than you think</h2>
                    <p>Every user should feel confident about sharing sensitive personal information on your website. That’s why using SSL encryption is essential.SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer which is a security protocol for ensuring authentication and privacy in online communications. In other words, SSL encrypts all sensitive data shared on your website and also attests to the authenticity of your website.</p>
                    <img src="../images/blogs/ecommerce-blog-4.jpg" alt="http vs https websites testing" class="img-fluid pt-3 pb-md-4 pb-3">
                    <p>SSL ensures that any sensitive data shared by visitors on your site are sent over a secure network -- you can create a secure connection from a web server to the browser using https protocol.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, SSL affects your ranking on search engines. SSL encrypted sites attract more traffic which is why SEO experts recommend not skipping it.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">6 - Pay attention to checkout design</h2>
                    <p>The absence of a smooth checkout process can alienate your customers and impact sales. For successful conversions, review the checkout design. For a seamless checkout experience:</p>
                    <ul class="pl-md-4 pl-3">
                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-2">Reduce the number of steps to checkout;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-2">Make registration optional;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-2">Support different payment options;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-2">Display prominent buttons on the page that talk about shipping and returns;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-2">Have a clear CTA button to encourage the customer to pay and complete the purchase.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/blogs/ecommerce-blog-5.jpg" alt="best practices to perfect ecommerce checkout" class="img-fluid pt-3 pb-md-4 pb-3">
                    <p>Post checkout, the customers should be able to access the order history and download the invoice. In case someone aborts the checkout midway without completing the purchase, don’t allow the items in the cart to expire. Use the <a href="https://asesasoft.com/digital-marketing-agency" target="_blank">information to send retargeted display ads or marketing emails</a>.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">7 - Design an admin dashboard that works for your business</h2>

                        <h2 class="blogTitle pt-4 pt-lg-5 h-auto">8 - Build a website that can grow with your business</h2>
                        <p>The traditional web development process can only take you so far. You will spend a considerable amount of time developing a website, only to redesign it again as the technology progresses.</p>
                        <img src="../images/blogs/ecommerce-blog-6.jpg" alt="Build a website that can grow with your business" class="img-fluid pt-3 pb-md-4 pb-3">
