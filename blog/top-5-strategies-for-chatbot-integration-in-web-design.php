                        <p>In <a href="https://asesasoft.com/website-design-and-development-company" target="_blank">web design</a>, the placement of elements is equally important to the design of the element. To make the most of the chatbot, position your chatbot prominently on your website. Ideally, it should greet visitors as they land on your homepage. </p>
                        <p>Placing it in the lower right corner or using a chat icon in the bottom left ensures it's easily accessible without obstructing the main content. This strategic placement ensures users can effortlessly engage with the chatbot when needed.</p>
